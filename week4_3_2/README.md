This is the week4 classical project, by group 2, it contains 2 projects among 4, including project A: Image stitching, and project B: object detection. As the workload of the first classical project is not heavy, we decide to do it seperately, each of us pick one intereseted project. It can be counted together as the final score of this classical project.
